# Protege Ventures Investment Memorandum

In Fall 2021, I participated in a Venture Capital bootcamp organised by [Protege Ventures](https://protege.vc/), Southeast Asia's first student venture fund.

We were tasked to create an investment memorandum to compare between two e-commerce startups, Omnirio and Prosperna. By conducting industry analysis, market sizing, competitor analysis, we came up with an investment thesis which recommended the fund to invest in Omnirio. We also came up with exit strategies, value creation strategies, and risk & mitigation analysis to advice the fund on their post-investment strategies.
